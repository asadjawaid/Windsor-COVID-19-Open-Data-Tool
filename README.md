 # Windsor COVID-19 Open Data Tool

We have developed an API by using the City of Windsor's open data portal and the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit COVID-19 cases information website. This API allows users to get the lastest information regarding COVID-19 cases, such as the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. In addition, with the confirmed cases it lists the amount of cases by date. Furthermore, we have collected data from the City of Windsor to get any information about all the hospitals in the Windsor, Ontario. With this data, it allows the users to get the neccessary information about the hospitals and gives them the option to calculate the distance from their location to any hospital they select.

# Languages used

When developing this data tool, we have used the Java programming langauge.

# Documentation Repository

A step-by-step guide is in the Documentation folder that gives the users a detailed guide on how to use the tool. Additionally, it contains all diagrams and testing strategy used to test the code.
